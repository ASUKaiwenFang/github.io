I am a Ph.D. student in Industrial Engineering at Arizona State University, specializing in optimization and algorithm development. My research focuses on large-scale mathematical programming, Benders decomposition, and data-driven optimization. I have strong experience implementing optimization frameworks in Python and Julia, with applications in operations research and machine learning. I am passionate about translating theoretical models into scalable, practical solutions for complex decision-making problems.
